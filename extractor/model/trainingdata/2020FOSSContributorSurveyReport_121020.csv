4,1,BODY,This report summarizes the results of a survey of free/open source software (FOSS) developers in 2020. The goal was to identify key issues in improving the security and sustainability of FOSS since the world now depends on it as critical infrastructure that underlies the modern economy. The survey was a collaboration between the Linux Foundation’s Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII) and the Laboratory for Innovation Science at Harvard (LISH). This work has been recently incorporated into the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) working group on securing critical projects.,18,76.6,505.55,584,54,162,559.55,238.6,FALSE,FALSE
4,2,BODY,"To capture a cross-section of the FOSS community, the research team distributed the survey to contributors to the most widely used open source projects (as determined by the previous “CII Census II Preliminary Report — Vulnerabilities in the Core.”) and also invited the wider FOSS contributor community through an open invitation. The response distribution was usually similar between these two groups, though there were exceptions (e.g., different programming languages’ prominence did vary). A total of 1,196 respondents filled out the demographic section and at least one question about current FOSS contributions, of whom 603 went through the entire survey.",18,90.6,499.57,662,54,260,553.57,350.6,FALSE,FALSE
4,3,BODY,"Of the respondents, 27% were in the United States, 12% were in Germany, and almost 7% were in France. The rest were diversified from countries around the world (see Figure 2a). The vast majority of respondents, nearly 75%, are employed full-time. The bulk of respondents are employed in tech-related industries (61%), although there is representation from other industries, including Finance, Transportation, Construction, Real Estate, Educational Services, and Healthcare. The survey found that over half of all respondents are paid to contribute to FOSS, though this varied greatly by country.",18,76.6,503.1,595,54,372,557.1,448.6,FALSE,FALSE

4,6,BODY,"Non-monetary motivations — specifically adding a needed feature or fix, enjoying learning, and fulfilling a need for creative/enjoyable work — were most frequently ranked in respondents’ top three motivations for contributing.

However, the overwhelming majority (74.87%) of respondents are already employed full-time, and more than half (51.65%) are specifically paid to develop FOSS. This observation must be tempered by remembering that this survey focuses on people, not projects. Some projects may not have anyone paid to contribute to them — even if they are critical and even if some of the contributors are being paid to work on other projects. Even though many contributors are paid for their work on some projects, it is possible that some critical projects could benefit from financial support for their contributors.",18,90.59,500.31,652,54,638,554.31,728.59,FALSE,FALSE

Further, paid contributors are more likely to rank their belief in the FOSS mission as an important motivator than the need for creative work.

34,7,BODY,"If these contributors, especially those who spend most of their paid working hours contributing to FOSS, then were redeployed to spend their working hours on internal proprietary work, would the volunteer contributors pick up the slack, or would there be a large decrease in the total amount of contribution effort towards FOSS? Of course, there are also some potential benefits to paid contribution efforts that could help lead to increased stability and sustainability in FOSS. Suppose more individuals are paid to work on FOSS. In that case, there is a decreased reliance on contributors having enough free time (which can ebb and flow due to life considerations, as discussed above) to maintain critical FOSS projects successfully. Suggested Actions: Balance Corporate and Project Interests To help address concerns related to corporate influence in FOSS, greater transparency of corporate involvement should be available. Although the level of corporate involvement in some large projects is clear, it is often less so in smaller projects. Corporate involvement in FOSS should be made clear to reduce accusations of hidden agendas. Further, to help reduce fears of companies retracting their participation, they can make clear commitments to support FOSS in general and specific FOSS projects for at least several years. Additionally, paid contributors should be incentivized to dedicate time mentoring new volunteer contributors to encourage new contributor development.",10,230.59,505.92,1476,54,428,559.92,658.59,FALSE,FALSE

35,2,BODY,"Despite companies’ increasing openness towards their employees’ involvement in FOSS, many still do not have clear FOSS policies. Over the last ten years, companies have increasingly allowed their employees to contribute to FOSS. 45.45% of respondents stated that they are free to contribute to FOSS without asking permission, compared to 35.84% ten years ago. Today, 30.30% of respondents can contribute after receiving permission, up from 24.78%  (for a total of 75.75% who may contribute to FOSS). However, 1.17% of respondents reported that their company does not permit employees to contribute to FOSS projects at all. Additionally, a significant percentage of respondents reported that their firms either have unclear policies (17.48%) or that they are unaware (5.59%) of what the policies are. By comparison, ten years ago only 35.84% were free to contribute without asking permission, 24.78% needed to ask permission, 7.08% were not permitted to contribute at all, 25.66% had unclear policies, and 6.64% were unsure of the policies in place. Although there have been positive changes over the past decade, there is still room for improvement. Suggested Actions: Clearer Policies for More FOSS Contributions Companies should embrace clear policies on FOSS. These policies should, ideally, allow FOSS contribution as this can benefit the company. This survey finds that the two top motivations as “love of learning” and “needed a feature in this FOSS” and that these two are highly connected. This means that software professionals gain significant and satisfying learning that is also highly beneficial for their work by using and contributing to FOSS. Previous studies have also shown that contributing to FOSS is associated with higher company productivity in many settings. Allowing employees to contribute to FOSS can also allow companies to attract higher caliber programming talent (65% of respondents said their current employer’s support of FOSS influenced their decision to join the organization, and 81% of respondents said the skills the acquired in FOSS were either valuable or very valuable to their current employer). Further, although companies are increasingly allowing their employees to contribute to FOSS, it would be ideal if they also made a push for their employees to contribute to the security of these projects, either individually or through collaborative efforts such as the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF).",10,384.59,506.6,2450,54,246,560.6,630.59,FALSE,FALSE

These results identified reasons for optimism about the future of FOSS (individuals are continuing to contribute to FOSS, companies are becoming friendlier to FOSS to the point of paying some employees to contribute, etc.), but also areas of concern (in particular, the lack of security-related efforts, and potential difficulties in motivating such efforts).",10,90.6,497.4,726,54,162,551.4,252.6,FALSE,FALSE
