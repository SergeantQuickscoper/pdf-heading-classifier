Through the convergence of existing schemes and specialized measures, the programme will cover 100 districts with low productivity, moderate crop intensity and below-average credit parameters. It aims to (1) enhance agricultural productivity, (2) adopt crop diversification and sustainable agriculture practices, (3) augment post-harvest storage at the panchayat and block level, (4) improve irrigation facilities, and (5) facilitate availability of long-term and short-term credit. This programme is likely to help 1.7 crore farmers. Building Rural Prosperity and Resilience 11. A comprehensive multi-sectoral ‘Rural Prosperity and Resilience’ programme will be launched in partnership with states. This will address under- employment in agriculture through skilling, investment, technology, and invigorating the rural economy.
