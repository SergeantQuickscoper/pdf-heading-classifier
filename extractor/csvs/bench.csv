Introduction and identifying the need: Understanding the unique needs of the user - empathize - define - ideate - prototype - test. Case Studies - Develop an appreciation for the design process and its application in specific settings (Guest lectures, Videos, Field visits, Interplay lectures of design-based movies).  Problem Formulation: Framing a problem statement neutrally using adequate checks. Case studies.  Concept Generation: Generate multiple concepts using various creativity tools and thinking styles.  Prototyping: Select from ideas and make quick prototypes (mock-ups) using available material. Evaluation: Iterative process of ideation, prototyping and testing-Take the mock-ups to users for feedback and iterate the process till users feel delighted.  Activities: Some of the activities which are undertaken as a part of this course include:",9.00,223.36,470.58,1083,63.86,375.17,534.44,598.53,false,false
